### Description
I know that Komori Corporation has parts catalog is inconvenient use!
I offer solution for simple finder parts and create yourself database.

My script will convert your parts catalog from html version to CSV file. I think your accounting software is support import from CSV. You don't need no longer create new part by hand, you just import created datebase and use it in comfortable app.
